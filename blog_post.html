            <p>Shared savings circles are a common practice in many emerging markets. 
                    “Tandas” in Latin America, “Hui” in China, “Susus” in West Africa and “Chamas” in East Africa. 
                    These informal organisations stem from the need to provide accessible credit to their members, backed by the social capital of the participating members. 
                    When executed well, savings & investments clubs can be a powerful means to uplift marginalised communities out of poverty and a means to deal with household financial shocks.
                    <br><br>In this blog post I will attempt to share an example of what it takes to sustain a savings & investment club over the years. I’ll also touch on strategies we employed to grow the team’s knowledge base and some of our key differentiators, our personal development track.</br>
                    <br><br>Six years ago, a few friends and I got together and formed a savings & investments club. In the past 4 years we have mastered the discipline of making timely contributions, allocating cash to investment products and we have also ventured into equity investments.
